##festive-glass

Repository of seasonal themed [Google Glass](https://developers.google.com/glass/) apps. Developed as tests to play around with the device capabilities; feel free to borrow, improve or mock ideas/methods contained within.

If you don't have a Glass, don't panic, these apps run fine on a stock Android device. You'll probably still need the [GDK](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/) though.

Some code/methods may have been inspired by space150's [glass playground](https://github.com/space150/google-glass-playground).

You'll probably want [launchy](https://github.com/kaze0/launchy) if you're planning on running Glass apps.

###Santaize

Requires [OpenCV for Android](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/android_binary_package/O4A_SDK.html).

Attempts to detect faces in the camera view and draw Santa hats on them. I say 'attempts' as the detection is somewhat shonky. The hat sizing is often off, and sometimes the positioning is as well.

###Let It Snow

In case you live somewhere sunny where it doesn't snow for Christmas, this app superimposes falling snow on the camera view.
